# Librarian

## Intro
Librarian is my first Laravel project which I started while watching Laracasts. The original application in the tutorial did something else (to-do managing) so this repository is mostly about some functionality I implemented.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to store information regarding a personal library, especially titles, authors and quick notes about conditions or availability on your shelf.

## Chalenges

### So far the most fun part was coming up with a simple search functionality that would allow me to display books with titles starting with each letter accordingly.
#### Initial before each section e.g. books starting with "B"
#### Not showing the initials when not required.
### Saving the state of a HTML checkbox while not checked seemed very obvious at first, but turned out to be a nice little lesson learned.

## @TO DO
### I am looking forward to working on these features:
#### New model for "Wishlist" to put new book ideas through
#### Logging in
#### Layout
